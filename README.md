Hobbot
======

A literate IRC bot (in less than 500 lines of OCaml).

If like me you always wanted a bot since you were a kid,
Or if you wanted to try literate programming for a long time,
If you are ready to welcome our new masters the bots,
Then wait no more!
This bot will help you write your own bots!

First steps:

- aptitude install funnelweb
- make
- ./hobbot.byte -help

and start coding your own bot!
